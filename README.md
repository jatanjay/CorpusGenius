	*Such as EPs,demos,bootlegs/singles/live performances/specials/etc.
3) A CSV file containing songs sung/released/performed but **NOT** written by the specified artist, along with their original
songwriters and the album it originally appears on for the specified artist in question
4) A CSV file containing lyrics of all songs
5) A CSV file containing lyrics of all songs released by year
6) A CSV file containing a single corpus of all songs stored in one single cell of csv file

*And of course, all the data will be fetched from genius.com*
