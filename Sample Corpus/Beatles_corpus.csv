somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon And one day his woman ran off with another guy Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnt like that He said, ""Im gonna get that boy"" So one day he walked into town Booked himself a room in the local saloon  Rocky Raccoon checked into his room Only to find Gideons bible But Rocky had come equipped with a gun To shoot off the legs of his rival  His rival it seems had broken his dreams By stealing the girl of his fancy Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil But everyone knew her as Nancy Now she and her man who called himself Dan Were in the next room at the hoedown Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown"" But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot And Rocky collapsed in the corner   Now the doctor came in stinking of gin And proceeded to lie on the table He said, ""Rocky, you met your match"" And Rocky said, ""Doc, its only a scratch And Ill be better, Ill be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""  Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room Only to find Gideons bible Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt To help with good Rockys revival  Cmon

Good King Wenceslas looked out On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!) As the slow ray round about Deep and crisp and crispy Brightly show the boot last night On the mosty cruel Henry Hall and David Lloyd Betty Grable too  Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) Were all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and its all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor the blimeys, heave the mo! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show  (whistling)  This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we cant believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) Id like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which Im trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) Id like to reply personally to everyone, but I just havent enough pens. In the meantime: Garry Crimble to you Garry Mimble to you Getty Bable, dear Christmas Happy Birthday me too  This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, were all dead pleased by the way youve treated us in 1963, and well try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, weve been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, weve gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing  Yes! Yes! Oh yes!  Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows cause its, you know, its great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...  Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!  ...to make new records, which is what weve been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, Im running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...  Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!  ...so Ill finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription  Ja, das wird uns danke schon Und denn gruss von even Ja, denn gruss von even schon Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy Danke schon Ja, Ringo! Hello, Ringo here As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups... (Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas) Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted (Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas) King Wenceslas: Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!) On the feast of Stephen (Hey!) When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!) Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!) Hooray! Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! Well phone you! (Ha ha ha!) Im George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, Id just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work theyve done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, cause its gonna, cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters And Id just like to say: Brightly was the shone that night Though the winter cruel When a pork pie came inside Gathering winter cruel Rudolph, the red nosed reindeer (Ho!)

You know those old pianos Okay were on. Mouth''We were talking about the space between us all And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth, then its far too late when they pass away  We were talking about the love we all could share When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew  Try to realise its all within yourself No one else can make you change And to see youre really only very small And life flows on within you and without you   We were talking about the love thats gone so cold And the people who gain the world and lose their soul They dont know, they cant see, are you one of them?  When youve seen beyond yourself then you may find Peace of mind is waiting there And the time will come when you see were all one And life flows on within you and without you'"
