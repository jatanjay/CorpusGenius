2008,"{'Broken lines, broken strings Broken threads, broken springs Broken idols, broken heads People sleeping in broken beds Aint no use jiving Aint no use joking Everything is broken  Broken bottles, broken plates Broken switches, broken gates Broken dishes, broken parts Streets are filled with broken hearts Broken words never meant to be spoken Everything is broken Seem like every time you stop and turn around Something else just hit the ground  Broken cutters, broken saws Broken buckles, broken laws Broken bodies, broken bones Broken voices on broken phones Take a deep breath, feel like youre choking Everything is broken Every time you leave and go off someplace Things fall to pieces in my face  Broken hands on broken ploughs Broken treaties, broken vows Broken pipes, broken tools People bending broken rules Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking Everything is broken', 'Im beginning to hear voices and theres no one around Well, Im all used up and the fields have turned brown I went to church on Sunday and she passed by My love for her is taking such a long time to die Im waist deep, waist deep in the mist Its almost like, almost like I dont exist Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound  The walls of pride are high and wide Cant see over to the other side Its such a sad thing to see beauty decay Its sadder still to feel your heart torn away One look at you and Im out of control Like the universe has swallowed me whole Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound  Theres too many people, too many to recall I thought some of m were friends of mine, I was wrong about m all Well, the road is rocky and the hillsides mud Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood I found my world, found my world in you But your love just hasnt proved true Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound  Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds Reality has always had too many heads Some things last longer than you think they will There are some kind of things you can never kill Its you and you only I been thinking about But you cant see in and its hard lookin out Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound  Well the fats in the fire and the waters in the tank The whiskeys in the jar and the moneys in the bank I tried to love and protect you because I cared Im gonna remember forever the joy that we shared Looking at you and Im on my bended knee You have no idea what you do to me Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound', 'Well, today has been a sad ol lonesome day Yeah, today has been a sad ol lonesome day Im just sitting here thinking With my mind a million miles away  Well, theyre doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor Theyre doing the double shuffle, theyre throwing sand on the floor When I left my long-time darling She was standing in the door  Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war My sister, she ran off and got married Never was heard of any more  Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months Dont know how it looked to other people I never slept with her even once  Well, the roads washed out--weather not fit for man or beast Yeah the roads washed out--weather not fit for man or beast Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with Are the things you need the least  Im forty miles from the mill--Im dropping it into overdrive Im forty miles from the mill--Im dropping it into overdrive Setting my dial on the radio I wish my mother was still alive  I see your lover-man coming--coming across the barren field I see your lover-man coming--coming across the barren field Hes not a gentleman at all--hes rotten to the core Hes a coward and he steals  Well my captain hes decorated--hes well schooled and hes skilled My captain, hes decorated--hes well schooled and hes skilled Hes not sentimental--dont bother him at all How many of his pals have been killed  Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was Last night the wind was whispering something--I was trying to make out what it was I tell myself somethings coming But it never does  Im gonna spare the defeated--Im gonna speak to the crowd Im gonna spare the defeated, boys, Im going to speak to the crowd I am going to teach peace to the conquered Im gonna tame the proud  Well the leaves are rustling in the wood --things are falling off of the shelf Leaves are rustling in the wood--things are falling off the shelf You gonna need my help, sweetheart You cant make love all by yourself', 'High water risin Risin night and day All the gold and silver Are being stolen away Big Joe Turner lookin East and West From the dark room of his mind He made it to Kansas City Twelfth Street and Vine Nothing standing there High water

they tell you to Or you dont dance at all."" Its tough out there High water everywhere I got a cravin love for blazing speed Got a hopped up Mustang Ford Jump into the wagon, love Throw your panties overboard I can write you poems Make a strong man lose his mind Im no pig without a wig I hope you treat me kind Things are breakin up out there High water everywhere High water risin Six inches bove my head Coffins droppin in the street Like balloons made out of lead Water pourin into Vicksburg Dont know what Im going to do ""Dont reach out for me,"" she said ""Cant you see Im drownin too?""

I told her I didnt really care High water everywhere Im getting up in the morning I believe Ill dust my broom Keeping away from the women Im givin em lots of room Thunder rolling over Clarksdale Everything is looking blue I just cant be happy, love Unless youre happy too Its bad out there High water everywhere', 'Every step of the way we walk the line Your days are numbered, so are mine Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape Were all boxed in, nowhere to escape  Citys just a jungle; more games to play Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away I was raised in the country, I been working in the town I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down  Got nothing for you, I had nothing before Dont even have anything for myself anymore Sky full of fire, pain pouring down Nothing you can sell me, Ill see you around  All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long  Well, the devils in the alley, mules in the stall Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all I was thinking bout the things that Rosie said I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosies bed  Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees Feeling like a stranger nobody sees So many things that we never will undo I know youre sorry, Im sorry too  Some people will offer you their hand and some wont Last night I knew you, tonight I dont I need something strong to distract my mind Im gonna look at you til my eyes go blind  Well I got here following the southern star I crossed that river just to be where you are Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long  Well my ships been split to splinters and its sinking fast Im drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past But my heart is not weary, its light and its free Ive got nothing but affection for all those whove sailed with me  Everybody moving if they aint already there Everybody got to move somewhere Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow Things should start to get interesting right about now  My clothes are wet, tight on my skin Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in I know that fortune is waiting to be kind So give me your hand and say youll be mine  Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay You can always come back, but you cant come back all the way Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long', 'Well Im sitting in church In an old wooden chair I knew nobody Would look for me there . . . Sorrow and pity . . . Rule the earth and the skies Looking for nothing Anyones eyes Once I had pretty girls Did me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long Snowflakes are falling Around my head Lord have mercy It feel heavy like lead . . . I been hit too hard . . . Seen too much Nothing can heal me now But your touch Once I had a pretty girl She done me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long Loneliness Got a mind of its own The more people around The more you feel alone . . . Im chained to the earth . . . Like a silent slave Trying to break free Out of deaths dark cave Once I had a pretty girl Done me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long Boys in the street Beginning to play Girls like birds Flying away . . . Im carrying the roses . . . That were given to me And Im thinking about paradise Wondering what it might be Once I had a pretty girl She done me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long Go over to London Maybe gay Paree Follow the river You get to the sea . . . I was hoping we could drink from . . . Lifes clear streams I was hoping we could dream Lifes pleasant dreams Once I had a pretty girl But she done me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long Well the weak get weaker And the strong stay strong The train keeps rolling All night long . . . She looked at me . . . With an irresistible glance With a smile That could make all the planets dance Once I had a pretty girl She did me wrong Now Im marching to the city And the road aint long My house is on fire Burning to the skies I thought the rain clouds But the clouds passed by . . .

lights and we live With the moonlight shooting by Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark To be where the angels fly Pretty maids all in a row lined up Outside my cabin door Ive never wanted any of them wanting me Except the girl from the Red River Shore Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried To make that girl my wife She gave me her best advice and she said Go home and lead a quiet life Well, I been to the east and I been to the west And I been out where the black winds roar Somehow though I never did get that far With the girl from the Red River Shore Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her I could never be free One look at her and I knew right away She should always be with me Well, the dream dried up a long time ago Dont know where it is anymore True to life, true to me Was the girl from the Red River Shore Well, Im wearing the cloak of misery And Ive tasted jilted love And the frozen smile upon my face Fits me like a glove Well, I cant escape from those memories Of the one that Ill always adore All those nights, when I lay in the arms Of the girl from the Red River Shore Well, were living in the shadows of a fading past Trapped in the fires of time Id tried not to ever hurt anybody And to stay out of a life of crime And when its all been said and done I never did know the score One more day is another day away From the girl from the Red River Shore Well, Im a stranger here in a strange land But I know this is where I belong Ill ramble and gamble for the one I love And the hills will give me a song Though nothing looks familiar to me I know Ive stayed here before Once, a thousand nights ago With the girl from the Red River Shore Well, I went back to see about her once Went back to straighten it out Everybody that I talked to had seen us there Said they didnt know who I was talking about Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago I had to go back from the door I wish I could have spent every hour of my life With the girl from the Red River Shore Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago A man full of sorrow and strife That if someone around him died and was dead He knew how to bring em on back to life Well, I dont know what kind of language he used Or if they do that kind of thing anymore Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all Except the girl from the Red River Shore', 'Ring them bells, ye heathen From the city that dreams Ring them bells from the sanctuaries Cross the valleys and streams For theyre deep and theyre wide And the worlds on its side And time is running backwards And so is the bride  Ring them bells St. Peter Where the four winds blow Ring them bells with an iron hand So the people will know Oh its rush hour now On the wheel and the plow And the sun is going down Upon the sacred cow  Ring them bells Sweet Martha For the poor mans son Ring them bells so the world will know That God is one Oh the shepherd is asleep Where the willows weep And the mountains are filled With lost sheep  Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf Ring them bells for all of us who are left Ring them bells for the chosen few Who will judge the many when the game is through Ring them bells, for the time that flies For the child that cries When innocence dies  Ring them bells St. Catherine From the top of the room Ring them from the fortress For the lilies that bloom Oh the lines are long And the fighting is strong And theyre breaking down the distance Between right and wrong', 'I was thinking of a series of dreams Where nothing comes up to the top Everything stays down where its wounded And comes to a permanent stop Wasnt thinking of anything specific Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams Nothing too very scientific Just thinking of a series of dreams  Thinking of a series of dreams Where the time and the tempo fly And theres no exit in any direction Cept the one that you cant see with your eyes Wasnt making any great connection Wasnt falling for any intricate scheme Nothing that would pass inspection Just thinking of a series of dreams  Dreams where the umbrella is folded Into the path you are hurled And the cards are no good that youre holding Unless theyre from another world  In one, numbers were burning In another, I witnessed a crime In one, I was running, and in another All I seemed to be doing was climb Wasnt looking for any special assistance Not going to any great extremes Id already gone the distance Just thinking of a series of dreams', 'The river whispers in my ear Ive hardly a penny to my name The heavens never seemed so near All of my body glows with flame The tempest struggles in the air And to myself alone I sing It could sink me then and there I can hear the echoes ring I tried to find one smiling face To drive the shadow from my head Im stranded in this nameless place Lying restless in a heavy bed Tell me straight out if you will Why must you torture me within? Why must you come from your high hill? Throw my fate to the clouds and wind Far away in a silent land Secret thoughts are hard to bear Remember me, youll understand Emotions we can never share You trampled on me as you passed Left the coldest kiss upon my brow All of my doubts and fears have gone at last Ive nothing more to tell you now I walk by tranquil lakes and streams As each new seasons dawn awaits I lay awake at night with troubled dreams The enemy is at the gate Beneath the thunder blasted trees The words are ringin off your tongue The ground is hard in times like these The stars are cold, the night is young The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare Iron clouds go floating by Snowflakes fallin in my hair Beneath the gray and stormy sky The evenin sun is sinkin low The woods are dark, the town is too Theyll drag you down, theyll run the show Aint no telling what theyll do Tell ol Bill when he comes home That anything is worth a try Tell him that Im not alone And that the hour has come to do or die All the world I would defy Let me make it plain as day I look at you now and I sigh How could it be any other way?', 'Most of the time Im clear focused all around Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground I can follow the path, I can read the signs Stay right with it when the road unwinds I can handle whatever I stumble upon I dont even notice she gone Most of the time  Most of the time Its well understood Most of the time I wouldnt change it if I could I can make it all match up, I can hold my own I can deal with the situation right down to the bone I can survive, I can endure And I dont even think about her Most of the time  Most of the time My head is on straight Most of the time Im strong enough not to hate I dont build up illusion till it makes me sick I aint afraid of confusion no matter how thick I can smile in the face of mankind Dont even remember what her lips felt like on mine Most of the time  Most of the time She aint even in my mind I wouldnt know her if I saw her Shes that far behind Most of the time I cant even be sure If she was ever with me Or if I was ever with her  Most of the time Im halfway content Most of the time I know exactly where it all went I dont cheat on myself, I dont run and hide Hide from the feelings that are buried inside I dont compromise and I dont pretend I dont even care if I ever see her again Most of the time', 'Some of us

a worried mind No one in front of me and nothing behind Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne Got white skin, got assassins eyes Im looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies Im well dressed,  waiting on the last train Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose  People are crazy and times are strange Im locked in tight, Im out of range I used to care, but things have changed  This place aint doing me any good Im in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood Just for a second there I thought I saw something move Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag Aint no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too Dont get up gentlemen, Im only passing through  People are crazy and times are strange Im locked in tight, Im out of range I used to care, but things have changed  Ive been walking forty miles of bad road If the Bible is right, the world will explode Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can Some things are too hot to touch The human mind can only stand so much You cant win with a losing hand Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street  People are crazy and times are strange Im locked in tight, Im out of range I used to care, but things have changed  I hurt easy, I just dont show it You can hurt someone and not even know it The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity Gonna get low down, gonna fly high All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake Im not that eager to make a mistake  People are crazy and times are strange Im locked in tight, Im out of range I used to care, but things have changed', 'I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream Heaven blazin in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream Somethin came up out of the sea Swept through the land of the rich and the free I look into the eyes of my merciful friend And then I ask myself, is this the end? Memories linger, sad yet sweet And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet Altars are burnin with flames far and wide The foe has crossed over from the other side They tip their caps from the top of the hill You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill Along the dim Atlantic line The ravaged land lies for miles behind The lights comin forward and the streets are broad All must yield to the avengin God The world is old, the world is gray Lessons of life cant be learned in a day I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand To the music that comes from a far better land Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know His long night is done, the great leader is laid low He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend Killed outright he was, by his own men Its the last days last hour of the last happy year I feel that the unknown world is so near Pride will vanish and glory will rot But virtue lives and cannot be forgot The bells of the evening have rung Theres blasphemy on every tongue Let em say that I walked in fair natures light And that I was loyal to truth and to right Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood They never dreamed of surrenderin, they fell where they stood Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star Youre walkin in dreams, whoever you are Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost A letter to mother came today Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say But hell be better soon, hes in a hospital bed But hell never be better, hes already dead Im ten miles outside the city and Im lifted away In an ancient light that is not of day They were calm, they were blunt, we knew em all too well We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell', 'I cant wait, wait for you to change your mind Its late, Im trying to walk the line Well, its way past midnight and there are people all around Some on their way up, some on their way down The air burns and Im trying to think straight And I dont know how much longer I can wait Im your man, Im trying to recover the sweet love that we knew You understand that my heart cant go on beating without you Well, your loveliness has wounded me, Im reeling from the blow I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so Im breathing hard, standing at the gate But I dont know how much longer I can wait Skies are grey, Im looking for anything that will bring a happy glow Night or day, it doesnt matter where I go anymore, I just go If I ever saw you coming I dont know what I would do Id like to think I could control myself, but it isnt true Thats how it is when things disintegrate And I dont know how much longer I can wait Im doomed to love you, Ive been rolling through stormy weather Im thinking of you and all the places we could roam together Its mighty funny, the end of time has just begun Oh, honey, after all these years youre still the one While Im strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate But I dont know how much longer I can wait', 'In the lonely night In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light Youre coming thru to me in black and white When we were made of dreams  Youre blowing down the shaky street Youre hearing my heart beat In the record-breaking heat Where we were born in time  Not one more night, not one more kiss Not this time baby, no more of this Takes too much skill, takes too much will Its revealing  You came, you saw, just like the law You married young, just like your ma You tried and tried, you made me slide You left me reeling with this feeling  On the rising curve Where the ways of nature will test every nerve You wont get anything you dont deserve Where we were born in time  You pressed me once, you pressed me twice You hang the flame, youll pay the price Oh babe, that fire  Is still smoking You were snow, you were rain You were striped, you were plain Oh babe, truer words Have not been spoken or broken  In the hills of mystery In the foggy web of destiny You can have whats left of me Where we were born in time', 'Im walking through streets that are dead Walking, walking with you in my head My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired And the clouds are weeping  Did I hear someone tell a lie? Did I hear someones distant cry? I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile While I was sleeping  Im sick of love but Im in the thick of it This kind of love Im so sick of it  I see, I see lovers in the meadow I see, I see silhouettes in the window I watch them till theyre gone and they leave me hanging on To a shadow  Im sick of love; I hear the clock tick This kind of love; Im lovesick  Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder Sometimes I want to take to the road and plunder Could you ever be true? I think of you And I wonder  Im sick of love; I wish Id never met you Im sick of love; Im trying to forget you  Just dont know what to do Id give anything to be with you', 'Fat man looking in a blade of steel Thin man looking at his last meal Hollow man looking in a cotton field For dignity  Wise man looking in a blade of grass Young man looking in the shadows that pass Poor man looking through painted glass For dignity  Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve Somebody said dignity was the first to leave I went into the city, went into the town Went into the land of the midnight sun  Searching high, searching low Searching everywhere I know Asking the cops wherever I go Have you seen dignity?  Blind man breaking out of a trance Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance Hoping to find one circumstance Of dignity  I went to the wedding of Mary Lou She said, ""I dont want nobody see me talking to you"" Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew About dignity  I went down where the vultures feed I wouldve gone deeper, but there wasnt any need Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men Wasnt any difference to me  Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade House on fire, debts unpaid Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid Have you seen dignity?  Drinking man listens to the voice he hears In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors Looking into the lost forgotten years For dignity  Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues Said hed give me information if his name wasnt used He wanted money up front, said he was abused By dignity  Footprints running across the silver sand Steps going down into tattoo land I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light In the border towns of despair  Got no place to fade, got no coat Im on the rolling river in a jerkin boat Trying to read a note somebody wrote About dignity  Sick man looking for the doctors cure Looking at his hands for the lines that were And into every masterpiece of literature For dignity  Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind Combing his hair back, his future looks thin Bites the bullet and he looks within For dignity  Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed Dignity never been photographed I went into the red, went into the black Into the valley of dry bone dreams  So many roads, so much at stake So many dead ends, Im at the edge of the lake Sometimes I wonder what its going to take To find dignity', 'Fat man looking into shining steel Thin man looking at his last meal Hollow man looking in a cottonfield For dignity Wise man looking in a blade of grass Young man looking in the shadows that pass Poor man looking through painted glass For dignity Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve Somebody said dignity was the last to leave Went into the cities, went into the towns To the land of the midnight sun Searching high, searching low Searching everywhere I know Asking the cops wherever I go Have you seen dignity? Blind man breaking out of a trance Puts both his hands into the pockets of chance Hoping to find one circumstance Of dignity Stranger stares down into the light From a platinum window in the Mexican night Searching every bloodsucking thing in sight For dignity I went down where the vultures feed Wouldve gone deeper, but there wasnt any need Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men It all sounded no different to me Soul of a nation is under the knife Death is standing in the doorway of life In the next room a man fighting with his wife Over dignity', 'In the lonely night In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light Youre coming thru to me in black and white When we were made of dreams Youre blowing down the shaky street Youre hearing my heart beat In the record-breaking heat Where we were born in time Not one more night, not one more kiss Not this time baby, no more of this Takes too much skill, takes too much will Its revealing You came, you saw, just like the law You married young, just like your ma You tried and tried, you made me slide You left me reeling with this feeling On the rising curve Where the ways of nature will test every nerve You wont get anything you dont deserve Where we were born in time You pressed me once, you pressed me twice You hang the flame, youll pay the price Oh babe, that fire Is still smoking You were snow, you were rain You were striped, you were plain Oh babe, truer words Have not been spoken or broken In the hills of mystery In the foggy web of destiny You can have whats left of me Where we were born in time', 'Im standing in the shadows with an aching heart Im looking at the world tear itself apart And its turned to hours, hours turned to days Im still loving you in a million ways  Well the devils in the alley, theres a mule kicking in my stall Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all I was raised in the country, Ive been working in town Ive been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down  Well I aint got nothing for you, I had nothing before Dont even have anything for myself anymore The sky is full of fire, pain is pouring down Theres nothing you can sell me, Ill see you around  Well I got here following the Southern star I crossed that river just to be where you are Theres only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long  Well Ive been loving you too long, I know you aint no good Dont make a bit of difference to me, dont see why it should I was thinking about the things that Rosie said I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosies bed  Well Im walking through the leaves falling from the trees I feel like a stranger nobody sees So many things we never will undo I know youre sorry, Im sorry too  Some people will offer their hand and some wont Last night I knew ya, tonight I dont I need something strong to distract my mind Im gonna look at you til my eyes go blind  Well everybodys moving, God knows where But Im still here, youre still there Only one thing I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long  Well my ships been split to splinters and its sinking fast Im drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past But my heart is not weary, its light and its free I got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me  Winter goes into the summer, summer goes into fall I look into the mirror, dont see anything at all Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow Things should start to get interesting right about now  My clothes are wet, tight on my skin And as tight as the corner that Ive painted myself in I know good fortune is waiting to be kind So give me your hand and say youll be mine  The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay You can always come back, but you cant come back all the way Only one thing that I did wrong Stayed in Mississippi a day too long', 'Oh the evening train is rolling All along the homeward way All my hopes are over the horizon All my dreams have gone away The hillside darkly shaded Stars fall from above All the joys of Earth have faded The nights untouched, my love Ill be here til tomorrow Beneath a shroud of gray I pretend Im free of sorrow My heart is miles away The dead bells are ringing My train is overdue To your memory Im clinging I cant escape from you Well I hear the sound of thunder Roaring loud and long Sometimes youve got to wonder God knows Ive done no wrong Youve wasted all your power You threw out the Christmas pie Now youre withering like a flower Youll play the fool and die Im neither sad nor sorry Im all dressed up in black I fought for fame and glory You tried to break my back In the far off sweet forever The sunshine peeking through We should have walked together I cant escape from you I cannot grasp the shadows That gather near the door Rain falls round my window I wish Id seen you more The path is ever winding The stars they never age The morning light is blinding All the worlds a stage Should be the time of gladness Happy faces everywhere The mystery of madness Is propagating in the air I dont like the city Not like some folks do Isnt it a pity I cant escape from you We plowed the fields of heaven Right down to the end I hope I can be forgiven If any words of mine offend All our days were splendid They were simple, they were plain It never should have ended I should have kissed you in the rain Ive been thinking things all over All the moments full of grace The primrose and the clover Your ever changing face Cant help looking at you You made love with god-knows-who Never found a gal to match you I cant escape from you', 'Most of the time Im

And as the yellow fog is lifting The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor She passes him on the spiral staircase Thinking hes the Soviet Ambassador She starts to speak, but he walks away As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway On Black Diamond Bay  A soldier sits beneath the fan Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring Lightning strikes, the lights blow out The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout ""Can you see anything?"" Then the Greek appears on the second floor In his bare feet with a rope around his neck While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle Says, ""Open up another deck"" But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, sil vous plait"" As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away From Black Diamond Bay  The desk clerk heard the woman laugh As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough He tried to grab the womans hand Said, ""Heres a ring, it cost a grand"" She said, ""That aint enough"" Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb She passed the door that the Greek had locked Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb"" She knocked upon it anyway As the sun went down and the music did play On Black Diamond Bay  ""Ive got to talk to someone quick!"" But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor He hung there from the chandelier She cried, ""Help, theres danger near Please open up the door!"" Then the volcano erupted And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner Thinking of forbidden love But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day"" As the stars fell down and the fields burned away On Black Diamond Bay  As the island slowly sank The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room The dealer said, ""Its too late now You can take your money, but I dont know how Youll spend it in the tomb"" The tiny man bit the soldiers ear As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew While shes out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her ""My  darling, je vous aime beaucoup "" She sheds a tear and then begins to pray As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away From Black Diamond Bay  I was sitting home alone one night in L.A Watching old Cronkite on the seven oclock news It seems there was an earthquake that Left nothing but a Panama hat And a pair of old Greek shoes Didnt seem like much was happening So I turned it off and went to grab another beer Seems like every time you turn around Theres another hard-luck story that youre going to hear And theres really nothing anyone can say And I

There were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadnt played publicly together since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoil--a lot of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed. If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that wed really done it this time--that the fans were going to burn the arena down. Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative gesture. Appearances can be deceiving. For this series of paintings, the idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common theme of these works having something to do with the American landscape--how you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what its worth. Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style. I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard it is cheating yourself of who you really are. My idea was to keep things simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to the moment realism--archaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They contradict the modern world. However, thats my doing. The San Francisco Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings. But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises. I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true. All the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating images--roads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges, motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs and symbols, etc.--all establishing a certain type of compositional value. I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory. Some of these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in some cases my hand couldnt do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you dont have to go to all that trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings,  Downtown Bank ,  Katzs ,  Nathans ,  Russ & Daughters ,  Roys ,  Blue Line , among others, and was able to get the desired effect. If that didnt work, I used a convex Plexiglass RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame, and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others I drew it straight on.  Topanga Ranch ,  Ice Cream Factory ,  Truck Stops ,  Flat Top Mt. Diner , and  Del Rio Cantina . The method with the particular altered lens was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines. The watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion, yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them. My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized, universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake ( Ice Cream Shack ,  Arcade ,  Threatening Skies ). Da Vinci paints a blurred picture--you see no lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And these paintings would probably fall into that category. An attempt was made to depersonalize the works--strip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not easily defined. In  Amusement Park Alleyway , the focus point is the Ferris wheel in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground but its not the focal point. In  Morning in Pittsburgh , the focal point would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the foreground. Just like in the  Flat Top Diner , the focal point might actually be the green trees. I tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the main feature. I restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features, and I view it as such ( Donut Shop ,  High Wire ). Whiplash curves, flying buttresses, pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects, bringing naturalism to the forefront. In some paintings, the brightness of reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow ( Sunset on the Prairie ,  Threatening Skies ). I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made light, yet sometimes it couldnt be avoided. An expert painter is a master in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. ""The Beaten Path"" however, reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic ( Oil Riggers Shack ,  Twilight After Dusk ). Flowing or curved lines form another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, ""The Beaten Path"" tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptions--things that are perceived in the visible world--taking the three dimensional into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence. If there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others, Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slim--artists that make us a lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely. There was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture, including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging, billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. ""The Beaten Path"" works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter. In every picture the viewer doesnt have to wonder whether its an actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all.', 'Johnnys in the basement, mixin up the medicine Im on the pavement, thinkin about the government The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off Says hes got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off Look out kid, its somethin you did God knows when, but youre doin it again You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen Wants 11 dollar bills - you only got 10  Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot Talkin that the heat put plants in the bed, but Phones tapped anyway Maggie says the many say They must bust in early May Orders from the D.A Look out kid, dont matter what you did Walk on your tip toes, dont tie no bows Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes You dont need a weather man to know which way the wind blows  Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail Look out kid, youre gonna get hit By losers, cheaters, six-time users Hanging round the theaters Girl by the whirlpools looking for a new fool Dont follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters  Oh, get born, keep warm Short pants, romance Learn to dance, get dressed Get blessed, try to be a success Please her, please him, buy gifts Dont steal, dont lift 20 years of schoolin and they put you on the day shift Look out kid, they keep it all hid Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle Dont wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals Dont want to be a bum, you better chew gum The pump dont work cause the vandals took the handles', 'Well I got trouble Troubles on my mind Yep, when I got in trouble Troubles on my mind Well, Im going to forget my trouble Leave my trouble behind, behind  Im going to swing it up Swing it down Got the fever, then wham, wham wham!

Red River Shore Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago A man full of sorrow and strife That if someone around him died and was dead He knew how to bring em on back to life Well, I dont know what kind of language he used Or if they do that kind of thing anymore Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all Except the girl from the Red River Shore', 'Time passes slowly up here in the mountain We sit beside the bridges and walk beside the fountains Catch the wild fishes that float though the stream Time passes slowly when youre lost in a dream Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking She sat in the kitchen while her mama was cooking Stared on out the window to the stars high above Time passes slowly when youre searching for love Aint no reason to go in a wagon to town Aint no reason to go to the fair Aint no reason to go up, aint no reason to go down Aint no reason to go anywhere Time passes slowly up here in the daylight We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day Time passes slowly and fades away', 'Went to see the gypsy Staying in a big hotel He smiled when he saw me coming And he said, ""Well, well, well"" His room was dark and crowded Lights were low and dim ""How are you?"" he said to me I said it back to him I went down to the lobby To make a small call out A pretty dancing girl was there And she began to shout ""Go on back to see the gypsy He can move you from the rear Drive you from your fear Bring you through the mirror He did it in Las Vegas And he can do it here"" Outside the lights were shining On the river of tears I watched them from the distance With music in my ears I went back to see the gypsy It was nearly early dawn The gypsys door was open wide But the gypsy was gone And that pretty dancing girl She could not be found So I watched that sun come rising From that little Minnesota town', 'Spirit on the water Darkness on the face of the deep I keep

understand you know too soon There is no sense in trying Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn Suicide remarks are torn From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn Plays wasted words, proves to warn That he not busy being born is busy dying Temptations page flies out the door You follow, find yourself at war Watch waterfalls of pity roar You feel to moan but unlike before You discover that youd just be one more Person crying So dont fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear Its alright, Ma, Im only sighing As some warn victory, some downfall Private reasons great or small Can be seen in the eyes of those that call To make all that should be killed to crawl While others say dont hate nothing at all Except hatred Disillusioned words like bullets bark As human gods aim for their mark Make everything from toy guns that spark To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark Its easy to see without looking too far That not much is really sacred While preachers preach of evil fates Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the president of the United States Sometimes must have to stand naked An though the rules of the road have been lodged Its only peoples games that you got to dodge And its alright, Ma, I can make it Advertising signs they con You into thinking youre the one That can do whats never been done That can win whats never been won Meantime life outside goes on All around you You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks they really found you A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit To satisfy, insure you not to quit To keep it in your mind and not forget That it is not he or she or them or it That you belong to Although the masters make the rules For the wise men and the fools I got nothing, Ma, to live up to For them that must obey authority That they do not respect in any degree Who despise their jobs, their destinies Speak jealously of them that are free Cultivate their flowers to be Nothing more than something they invest in While some on principles baptized To strict party platform ties Social clubs in drag disguise Outsiders they can freely criticize Tell nothing except who to idolize And then say God bless him While one who sings with his tongue on fire Gargles in the rat race choir Bent out of shape from societys pliers Cares not to come up any higher But rather get you down in the hole That hes in But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault But its alright, Ma, if I cant please him Old lady judges watch people in pairs Limited in sex, they dare To push fake morals, insult and stare While money doesnt talk, it swears Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony While them that defend what they cannot see With a killers pride, security It blows the minds most bitterly For them that think deaths honesty Wont fall upon them naturally Life sometimes must get lonely My eyes collide head-on with stuffed Graveyards, false gods, I scuff At pettiness which plays so rough Walk upside-down inside handcuffs Kick my legs to crash it off Say okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me? And if my thought-dreams could be seen Theyd probably put my head in a guillotine But its alright, Ma, its life, and life only', 'Hollis Brown He lived on the outside of town Hollis Brown He lived on the outside of town With his wife and five children And his cabin broken down  He looked for work and money And he walked a ragged mile He looked for work and money And ya walked a ragged mile Your children are so hungry That they dont know how to smile  Your babys eyes look crazy Theyre a-tugging at your sleeve Your babys eyes look crazy Theyre a-tugging at your sleeve You walk the floor and wonder why With every breath you breathe  The rats have got your flour Bad blood it got your mare The rats have got your flour Bad blood it got your mare If theres anyone that knows Is there anyone that cares?

As she, herself, prepares for him And Madonna, she still has not showed We see this empty cage now corrode Where her cape of the stage once had flowed The fiddler, he now steps to the road He writes evrythings been returned which was owed On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain', 'How long can I stay in this nowhere cafe Before night turns into day I wonder why Im so frightened of dawn All I have and all I know Is this dream of you Which keeps me living on  Theres a moment when all old things Become new again But that moment might have come and gone All I have and all I know Is this dream of you Which keeps me living on  I look away, but I keep seeing it I dont want to believe, but I keep believing it Shadows dance upon the wall Shadows that seem to know it all  Am I too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me Im lost in the crowd All my tears are gone All I have and all I know Is this dream of you Which keeps me living on  Everything I touch seems to disappear Everywhere I turn you are always here Ill run this race until my earthly death Ill defend this place with my dying breath  From a cheerless room in a curtained gloom I saw a star from heaven fall I turned and looked again but it was gone All I have and all I know Is this dream of you Which keeps me living on', 'Bye and bye, Im breathin a lovers sigh Im sittin on my watch so I can be on time Im singin loves praises with sugar-coated rhyme Bye and bye, on you Im casting my eye Im paintin the town--swinging my partner around I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust Im watchin the roads, Im studying the dust Im paintin the town making my last go-round Well, Im scufflin and Im shufflin and Im walkin on briars Im not even acquainted with my own desires Im rollin slow--Im doing all I know Im tellin myself I found true happiness That Ive still got a dream that hasnt been repossessed Im rollin slow, goin where the wild roses grow Well the future for me is already a thing of the past You were my first love and you will be my last Papa gone mad, mamma, shes feeling sad Im gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more Im gonna establish my rule through civil war Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be', 'Yes, the gal I got I swear shes the screaming end She wants me to be a hero So she can tell all her friends  Well, she begged, she cried She pleaded with me all last night Well, she begged, she cried She pleaded with me all last night She wants me to go out And find somebody to fight  She reads too many books She got new movies inside her head She reads too many books She got movies inside her head She wants me to walk out running She wants me to crawl back dead  You need a different kinda man, babe One that can grab and hold your heart Need a different kind of man, babe One that can hold and grab your heart You need a different kind of man, babe You need Napoleon Boneeparte  Well, when Im dead No more good times will I crave When Im dead No more good times will I crave You can stand and shout hero All over my lonesome grave', 'Come you masters of war You that build all the guns You that build the death planes You that build the big bombs You that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to know I can see through your masks You that never done nothin But build to destroy You play with my world Like its your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from my eyes And you turn and run farther When the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe But I see through your eyes And I see through your brain Like I see through the water That runs down my drain You fasten the triggers For the others to fire Then you set back and watch When the death count gets higher You hide in your mansion As young peoples blood Flows out of their bodies And is buried in the mud Youve thrown the worst fear That can ever be hurled Fear to bring children Into the world For threatening my baby Unborn and unnamed You aint worth the blood That runs in your veins How much do I know To talk out of turn You might say that Im young You might say Im unlearned But theres one thing I know Though Im younger than you Even Jesus would never Forgive what you do Let me ask you one question Is your money that good Will it buy you forgiveness Do you think that it could I think you will find When your death takes its toll All the money you made Will never buy back your soul And I hope that you die And your deathll come soon I will follow your casket In the pale afternoon And Ill watch while youre lowered Down to your deathbed And Ill stand oer your grave Til Im sure that youre dead', 'When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. Im going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful. If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess Id have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved - the music I grew up on: country western, rock n roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One brand. And Buddy wrote songs - songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. And he sang great - sang in more than a few voices. He was the archetype. Everything I wasnt and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play, and I wasnt disappointed. He was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing. I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didnt know what. And it gave me the chills. I think it was a day or two after that that his plane went down. And somebody - somebody Id never seen before - handed me a Leadbelly record with the song ""Cottonfields"" on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world Id never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like Id been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times. It was on a label Id never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, string bands. Id never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had a feeling for the music Id grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about it. Didnt even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone. I hadnt left home yet, but I couldnt wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those songs. They were different than the radio songs that Id been listening to all along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didnt matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not. I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard. By listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points, and you learn the details. You know what its all about. Takin the pistol out and puttin it back in your pocket. Whippin your way through traffic, talkin in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and youve heard the deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy creek. And youre pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy. You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. Youve seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have been wrapped in white linen. I had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric. None of it went over my head - the devices, the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries - and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on, too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it. But I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gullivers Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest - typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental. Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school - I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey.  Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book thats filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab - captain of a ship called the Pequod -  an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. Its an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahabs got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen. The ships crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for details about Moby. Have they seen him? Theres a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahabs doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ships captain - Captain Boomer - he lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and hes happy to have survived. He cant accept Ahabs lust for vengeance. This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Marthas Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe. Moby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator, says, ""Call me Ishmael."" Somebody asks him where hes from, and he says, ""Its not down on any map. True places never are."" Stubb gives no significance to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmaels been on a sailing ship his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his distance from people. A typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks its a good omen. Starbuck thinks its a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ships mast and drowns, foreshadowing whats to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, ""Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness."" Everything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules - theyre all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale. Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil - good for coronation of royalty - noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination - everything thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife. We see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Heres a face. Ill put it in front of you. Read it if you can. Tashtego says that he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasnt saved by Christ, though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He parodies the resurrection. When Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, ""Speak not to me of blasphemy, man, Id strike the sun if it insulted me."" Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He says, ""The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run.""  Or these lines, ""All visible objects are but pasteboard masks."" Quotable poetic phrases that cant be beat. Finally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahabs harpoon has been baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahabs boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahabs boat again. On the third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave. Ishmael survives. Hes in the sea floating on a coffin. And thats about it. Thats the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs.  All Quiet on the Western Front was another book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. Youre stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death and pain. Youre defending yourself from elimination. Youre being wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world, and now youre shooting it to pieces. Day after day, the hornets bite you and worms lap your blood. Youre a cornered animal. You dont fit anywhere. The falling rain is monotonous. Theres endless assaults, poison gas, nerve gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth and excrement. Someone shouts, ""Hey, you there. Stand and fight."" Who knows how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. Youre being annihilated, and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, youll spend the rest of your life looking after his family. Whos profiting here? The leaders and the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But youre doing the dirty work. One of your comrades says, ""Wait a minute, where are you going?"" And you say, ""Leave me alone, Ill be back in a minute."" Then you walk out into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You cant see how anybody in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their desires - you cant comprehend it. More machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. Theyre your prized possession. But soon theyll be on somebody elses feet. Theres Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running out. ""Its not fair to come at us again so soon,"" you say. One of your companions is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone else says, ""You might save yourself a trip."" ""What do you mean?"" ""Turn him over, youll see what I mean."" You wait to hear the news. You dont understand why the war isnt over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops that theyre drafting young boys who are of little military use, but theyre draftin em anyway because theyre running out of men. Sickness and humiliation have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters, your ministers, and even your own government. The general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed you too - turned you into a thug and a murderer. If you could, youd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize that if you had the money, youd put up a reward for any man who would take his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that, then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his coffee - hes another one. Spends all his time in the officers brothel. Youd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack fo me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils. Youve come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness, into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, ""Im only twenty years old, but Im capable of killing anybody. Even my father if he came at me."" Yesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog, and somebody shouted, ""Dont be a fool."" One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives. You know you should finish the job, but you cant. Youre on the real iron cross, and a Roman soldiers putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips. Months pass by. You go home on leave. You cant communicate with your father. He said, ""Youd be a coward if you dont enlist."" Your mother, too, on your way back out the door, she says, ""You be careful of those French girls now."" More madness. You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month it gets taken back. All that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy, that wisdom - Plato, Aristotle, Socrates - what happened to it?  It should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again youre a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. Its a pleasant memory. More bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You cant even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen. The common grave. There are no other possibilities. Then you notice the cherry blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun - you see how nature is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature doesnt even notice it. Youre so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of your head and youre dead. Youve been ruled out, crossed out. Youve been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to read another war novel again, and I never did. Charlie Poole from North Carolina had a song that connected to all this. Its called ""You Aint Talkin to Me,"" and the lyrics go like this: I saw a sign in a window walking up town one day. Join the army, see the world is what it had to say. Youll see exciting places with a jolly crew, Youll meet interesting people, and learn to kill them too. Oh you aint talkin to me, you aint talking to me. I may be crazy and all that, but I got good sense you see. You aint talkin to me, you aint talkin to me. Killin with a gun dont sound like fun. You aint talkin to me.  The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: ""Homeward Bound, ""Green, Green Grass of Home,"" ""Home on the Range,"" and my songs as well. The Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in a war. Hes on that long journey home, and its filled with traps and pitfalls. Hes cursed to wander. Hes always getting carried out to sea, always having close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldnt. Theres troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. Hes always trying to rescue somebody. Hes a travelin man, but hes making a lot of stops. Hes stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them. He meets giants that say, ""Ill eat you last."" And he escapes from giants. Hes trying to get back home, but hes tossed and turned by the winds. Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown back. Hes always being warned of things to come. Touching things hes told not to. Theres two roads to take, and theyre both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. Hes exhausted. He falls asleep, and hes woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. Hes been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. Its been a hard road to travel. In a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And youve had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And youve also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And thats still not all of it. When he gets back home, things arent any better. Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage of his wifes hospitality. And theres too many of em. And though hes greater than them all and the best at everything - best carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman - his courage wont save him, but his trickery will. All these stragglers will have to pay for desecrating his palace. Hell disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servants arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. Hes one against a hundred, but theyll all fall, even the strongest. He was nobody. And when its all said and done, when hes home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the stories. *** So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, thats all thats important. I dont have to know what a song means. Ive written all kinds of things into my songs. And Im not going to worry about it - what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I dont think he would have worried about it either - what it all means. John Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words, ""The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests."" I dont know what it means, either. But it sounds good. And you want your songs to sound good. When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld - Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory -  tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. ""I just died, thats all."" There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is - a king in the land of the dead - that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place. Thats what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. Theyre meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeares plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, ""Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.""', 'I dont care what you do, I dont care what you say I dont care where you go or how long you stay Someday baby, you are not going to worry po me any more  Well you take my money and you turn me out You fill me up with nothing but self doubt Someday baby, you are not going to worry po me anymore  When I was young, driving was my grave You drive me so hard, almost to the grave Someday baby, you are not going to worry po me anymore  Im so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots I keep recycling the same old thoughts Someday baby you are not going to worry Po me anymore  So many good things in life that I overlooked I dont know what to do now, you got me so hooked Someday baby you are not going to worry po me any more  Well, I dont want to brag, but Im going to ring your neck When all else fails Ill make it a matter of self-respect Someday baby, you are not going to worry Po me any more  You can take your clothes put him in a sack You gain down the road, baby and you cant come back Someday baby you are not going to worry po me any more  I try to be friendly, I try to be kind Now Im gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine Someday baby you are not going to worry po me any more  Living this way is not a natural thing to do Why was I born to love you? Someday baby, you are not going to worry po me any more', 'When she said ""Dont waste your words, theyre just lies"" I cried she was deaf And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes Then said, ""What else you got left?"" It was then that I got up to leave But she said, ""Dont forget Everybody must give something back For something they get"" I stood there and hummed I tapped on her drum and asked her how come And she buttoned her boot And straightened her suit Then she said, ""Dont get cute"" So I forced my hands in my pockets And felt with my thumbs And gallantly handed her My very last piece of gum She threw me outside I stood in the dirt where evryone walked And after finding Id Forgotten my shirt I went back and knocked I waited in the hallway, she went to get it And I tried to make sense Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair That leaned up against . .  Her Jamaican rum And when she did come, I asked her for some She said, ""No, dear"" I said, ""Your words arent clear Youd better spit out your gum"" She screamed till her face got so red Then she fell on the floor And I covered her up and then Thought Id go look through her drawer And when I was through I filled up my shoe And brought it to you And you, you took me in You loved me then You didnt waste time And I, I never took much I never asked for your crutch Now dont ask for mine', 'Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill? Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt? Ive been burned before and I know the score So you wont hear me complain Will I be able to count on you Or is your love in vain? Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude? When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude? Do you know my world, do you know my kind Or must I explain? Will you let me be myself Or is your love in vain? Well Ive been to the mountain and Ive been in the wind Ive been in and out of happiness I have dined with kings, Ive been offered wings And Ive never been too impressed All right, Ill take a chance, I will fall in love with you If Im a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow Do you understand my pain?

about Suddenly appears What cannot be imitated Perfect must die Farewell Angelina The skys flooding over And I must go where it is dry  Machine guns are roaring Puppets heave rocks At misunderstood

""Eternity?"" said Frankie Lee With a voice as cold as ice ""Thats right,"" said Judas, ""Eternity Though you might call it Paradise"" ""I dont call it anything"" Said Frankie Lee with a smile ""All right,"" said Judas Priest ""Ill see you after a while""  Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down Feeling low and mean When just then a passin stranger Burst upon the scene Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler Whose fathers deceased? Well, if you are, theres a fellow callin you down the road And they say his name is Priest""  ""Oh, yes, he is my friend"" Said Frankie Lee in fright ""I do recall him very well In fact, he just left my sight"" ""Yes, thats the one,"" said the stranger As quiet as a mouse ""Well, my message is, hes down the road Stranded in a house""  Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked He dropped everything and ran Until he came up to the spot Where Judas Priest did stand ""What kind of house is this,"" he said ""Where I have come to roam?"" ""Its not a house,"" says Judas Priest ""Its not a house, its a home""  Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled He soon lost all control Over evrything which he had made While the mission bells did toll He just stood there staring At that big house as bright as any sun With four and twenty windows And a womans face in evry one  Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee With a soulful, bounding leap And, foaming at the mouth He began to make his midnight creep For sixteen nights and days he raved But on the seventeenth he burst Into the arms of Judas Priest Which is where he died of thirst  No one tried to say a thing When they carried him out in jest Except, of course, the little neighbor boy Who carried him to rest And he just walked along, alone With his guilt so well concealed And muttered underneath his breath ""Nothing is revealed""  Well, the moral of this story The moral of this song Is simply that one should never be Where one does not belong So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin Help him with his load And dont go mistaking Paradise For that home across the road', 'You say that youre fed up You say youre gonna head off Then you run around packin Like a chicken with your head off I just wanna ask you Honey where are you at?

Its not a poem, its... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. Hes really something else more than a folk singer and theres this book coming out thats dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldnt do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But Id like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, its a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called ""Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie""  When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb When you think youre too old, too young, too smart or too dumb When yer laggin behind an losing yer pace In a slow-motion crawl of lifes busy race No matter what yer doing if you start givin up If the wine dont come to the top of yer cup If the winds got you sideways with one hand holdin on And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it And the woods easy findin but yer lazy to fetch it And yer sidewalk starts curlin and the street gets too long And you start walkin backwards though you know its wrong And lonesome comes up as down goes the day And tomorrows morning seems so far away And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin And yer rope is a-slidin cause yer hands are a-drippin And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipes a-pourin And the lightnins a-flashing and the thunders a-crashin And the windows are rattlin and breakin and the roof tops a-shakin And yer whole worlds a-slamming  and banging And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm And to yourself you sometimes say ""I never knew it was gonna be this way Why didnt they tell me the day I was born"" And you start gettin chills and yer jumping from sweat And youre looking for something you aint quite found yet And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air And the whole worlds a-watching with a window peek stare And yer good gal leaves and shes long gone a-flying And yer heart feels sick like fish when theyre frying And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet And you need it badly but it lays on the street And yer bells bangin loudly but you cant hear its beat And you think yer ears might a been hurt Or yer eyesve turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush When you were faked out an fooled while facing a four flush And all the time you were holdin three queens And its making you mad, its makin you mean Like in the middle of Life magazine Bouncin around a pinball machine And theres something on yer mind you wanna be saying That somebody someplace oughta be hearin But its trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head And it bothers you badly when youre laying in bed And no matter how you try you just cant say it And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead And the lions mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth And his jaws start closing with you underneath And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind And you wish youd never taken that last detour sign And you say to yourself just what am I doing On this road Im walkin, on this trail Im turnin On this curve Im hanging On this pathway Im strolling, in the space Im taking In this air Im inhaling Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard Why am I walking, where am I running What am I saying, what am I knowing On this guitar Im playing, on this banjo Im frailin On this mandolin Im strumming, in the song Im singin In the tune Im humming, in the words Im writin In the words that Im thinking In this ocean of hours Im all the time drinkin Who am I helping, what am I breaking What am I giving, what am I taking But you try with your whole soul best Never to think these thoughts and never to let Them kind of thoughts gain ground Or make yer heart pound But then again you know when theyre around Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down Cause sometimes you hearem when the night times comes creeping And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin And you cant remember for the best of yer thinking If that was you in the dream that was screaming And you know that its something special youre needin And you know that theres no drug thatll do for the healin And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding And you need something special Yeah, you need something special all right You need a fast flying train on a tornado track To shoot you someplace and shoot you back You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler Thats been banging and booming and blowing forever That knows yer troubles a hundred times over You need a Greyhound bus that dont bar no race That wont laugh at yer looks Your voice or your face And by any number of bets in the book Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze You need something to open up a new door To show you something you seen before But overlooked a hundred times or more You need something to open your eyes You need something to make it known That its you and no one else that owns That spot that yer standing, that space that youre sitting That the world aint got you beat That it aint got you licked It cant get you crazy no matter how many Times you might get kicked You need something special all right You need something special to give you hope But hopes just a word That maybe you said or maybe you heard On some windy corner round a wide-angled curve  But thats what you need man, and you need it bad And yer trouble is you know it too good Cause you look an you start getting the chills  Cause you cant find it on a dollar bill And it aint on Macys window sill And it aint on no rich kids road map And it aint in no fat kids fraternity house And it aint made in no Hollywood wheat germ And it aint on that dimlit stage With that half-wit comedian on it Ranting and raving and taking yer money And you think its funny No you cant find it in no night club or no yacht club And it aint in the seats of a supper club And sure as hell youre bound to tell That no matter how hard you rub You just aint a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub No, and it aint in the rumors peoplere tellin you And it aint in the pimple-lotion people are sellin you And it aint in no cardboard-box house Or down any movie stars blouse And you cant find it on the golf course And Uncle Remus cant tell you and neither can Santa Claus And it aint in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes And it aint in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons And it aint in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices That come knockin and tappin in Christmas wrappin Sayin aint I pretty and aint I cute and look at my skin Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry When you cant even sense if they got any insides These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows No youll not now or no other day Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache And inside it the people made of molasses That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses And it aint in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies Whod turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny Who breathe and burp and bend and crack And before you can count from one to ten Do it all over again but this time behind yer back My friend The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl And play games with each other in their sand-box world And you cant find it either in the no-talent fools That run around gallant And make all rules for the ones that got talent And it aint in the ones that aint got any talent but think they do And think theyre foolin you The ones who jump on the wagon Just for a while cause they know its in style To get their kicks, get out of it quick And make all kinds of money and chicks And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat Sayin, ""Christ do I gotta be like that Aint there no one here that knows where Im at Aint there no one here that knows how I feel Good God Almighty THAT STUFF AINT REAL"" No but that aint yer game, it aint yer race You cant hear yer name, you cant see yer face You gotta look some other place And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin Where do you look for this lamp thats a-burnin Where do you look for this oil well gushin Where do you look for this candle thats glowin Where do you look for this hope that you know is there And out there somewhere And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways You can touch and twist And turn two kinds of doorknobs You can either go to the church of your choice Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital Youll find God in the church of your choice Youll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital  And though its only my opinion I may be right or wrong Youll find them both In the Grand Canyon At sundown', 'You angel, you Your essence got me under your wing The way you walk and the way you talk I feel I could almost sing You angel, you Youre as fine as anythings fine I just walk and watch you talk With you memory of my mind You know I cant sleep at night for

planning for a fall The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down Anyone with any sense had already left town He was standing in the doorway looking like  the Jack of Hearts  He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set it up for everyone,"" he said Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin ""Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"" Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts  Backstage the girls were playing  five-card stud  by the stairs Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts  Big Jim was no ones fool, he owned the towns only diamond mine He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town She slipped in through the side door  looking like a queen without a crown She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear ""Sorry, darling, that Im late,"" but he didnt seem to hear He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts  ""I know Ive seen that face somewhere,"" Big Jim was thinking to himself "" Maybe down in Mexico  or a picture up on somebodys shelf"" But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts  Lily was a princess , she was fair-skinned and precious as a child She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere But shed never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts  The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind It was known all around that Lily had Jims ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the  king No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife She was tired of the attention , tired of playing the role of Big Jims wife She had done a lot of bad things,  even once tried suicide Was looking to do just one good deed before she died She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts  Lily took her dress off, buried it away ""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you must Have known it would someday Be careful not to touch the wall, theres a brand-new coat of paint Im glad to see youre still alive, youre looking like a saint"" Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts  The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair ""Theres something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air"" He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts  No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick The door to the dressing room burst open and  a Colt revolver clicked And Big Jim was standing there,  ya couldnt say surprised Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes She was with Big Jim but  she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts  Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, its said that they got off with quite a haul In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town But they couldnt go no further without the Jack of Hearts  The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black Big Jim lay covered up,  killed by a penknife in the back And Rosemary on the gallows, she didnt even blink The hanging judge was sober, he hadnt had a drink The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts  The cabaret was empty now,  a sign said, ""Closed for repair"" Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair She was thinking bout her father, who she very rarely saw Thinking bout Rosemary and thinking about the law But most of all she was thinking bout the Jack of Hearts', 'Well, shes got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town Shes five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch She got all the downtown boys, all at her command But youve got to watch her closely cause she aint no woman Shes a man', 'One time in London Id gone out for a walk Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of

""for anybodys eyes If youve never seen one its a blessing in disguise""  I moved in closer, got up on my toes Two men in front of me were coming to blows The man was saying something bout children when theyre young Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung  ""The news of the day is on all the time All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free Dont let an egg get laid in it by something you cant see""  ""Pray for peace!"" he said.

inside the doorways, thunder went crashing As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds Seemin to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight And for each and every underdog soldier in the night And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Through the citys melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched With faces hidden as the walls were tightening As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain Dissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze Leavin only bells of lightning and its thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales For disrobed faceless forms of no position Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts All down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Even though a clouds white curtain in a far-off corner flared And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look Spellbound and swallowed til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin', 'Oh, the time will come up When the winds will stop And the

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense Take what you have gathered from coincidence The empty handed painter from your streets Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  The sky, too, is folding under you And its all over now, Baby Blue  All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home All your reindeer armies are all going home Your lover who just walked out the door Has taken all his blankets from the floor  The carpet, too, is moving under you And its all over now, Baby Blue  Leave your stepping stones behind Theres something that calls for you Forget the dead youve left They will not follow you The vagabond whos rapping at your door Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  Strike another match, go start anew And its all over now, Baby Blue'}"

of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn I courted her proudly but now she is gone Gone as the season shes taken  In a young summers youth, I stole her away From her mother and sister, though close did they stay Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us  Of the two sisters, I loved the young With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone By the jealousy of others around her  For her parasite sister, I had no respect Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect Countless visions of the other shed reflect As a crutch for her scenes and her society  Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused The changes I was going through cant even be used For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime  With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped Noticing not that Id already slipped To the sin of loves false security  From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace Answers of emptiness voice vacancies Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please Whats wrong, whats exactly the matter?  And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen The timeless explosion of fantasys dream At the peak of the night, the king and the queen Tumbled all down into pieces  ""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout ""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"" And I in my armor,  turning about And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness  Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound Her sister and I in a screaming battleground And she in between, the victim of sound Soon shattered as a child to the shadows  All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night Leaving all of loves ashes behind me  The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet The words to say Im sorry, I havent found yet I think of her often and hope whoever shes met Will be fully aware of how precious she is  Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""

majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds Seemin to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight And for each and every underdog soldier in the night And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Through the citys melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched With faces hidden as the walls were tightening As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain Dissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze Leavin only bells of lightning and its thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales For disrobed faceless forms of no position Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts All down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Even though a clouds white curtain in a far-off corner flared And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look Spellbound and swallowed til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin', 'Oh, the time will come up When the winds will stop And the breeze will cease to be breathin Like the stillness in the wind Before the hurricane begins The hour that the ship comes in And the sea will split And the ships will hit And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking Then the tide will sound And the waves will pound And the mornin will be a-breakin The fishes will laugh As they swim out of the path And the seagulls, theyll be smilin And the rocks on the sand Will proudly stand The hour that the ship comes in And the words that are used For to get the ship confused Will not be understood as theyre spoken For the chains of the sea Will have busted in the night And be buried on the bottom of the ocean A song will lift As the mainsail shifts And the boat drifts on to the shoreline And the sun will respect Every face on the deck The hour that the ship comes in Then the sands will roll Out a carpet of gold For your weary toes to be a-touchin And the ships wise men Will remind you once again That the whole wide world is watchin Oh, the foes will rise With the sleep still in their eyes And theyll jerk from their beds and think theyre dreamin But theyll pinch themselves and squeal And theyll know that its for real The hour that the ship comes in And theyll raise their

trying To deal with the dying Though I cannot explain that in lines  Your cracked country lips I still wish to kiss As to be by the strength of your skin Your magnetic movements Still capture the minutes Im in But it grieves my heart, love To see you trying to be a part of A world that just dont exist Its all just a dream, babe A vacuum, a scheme, babe That sucks you into feelin like this  I can see that your head Has been twisted and fed With the worthless foam from the mouth I can tell you are torn Between staying and returning Back to the South Youve been fooled into thinking That the finishing end is at hand Yet theres no one to beat you No one to defeat you cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad  Ive heard you say many times That youre better than no one And no one is better than you If you really believe that You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose From fixtures and forces and friends Your sorrow does stem That hype you and type you Making you feel That you gotta be just like them  Id forever talk to you But soon my words Would turn into a meaningless ring For deep in my heart I know theres no help I can bring Everything passes Everything changes Just do what you think you should do And someday maybe Who knows, baby Ill come and be crying to you'}"

Wing  From the dirty old mess hall You march to the brick wall Too weary to talk And too tired to sing And its all afternoon You remember your hometown All inside the walls The walls of Red Wing  Oh, the gates are cast iron And the walls are barbed wire Stay far from the fence With the lectricity sting And its keep down your head And stay in your number All inside the grounds of The walls of Red Wing  Oh, its fare thee well To the deep hollow dungeon Farewell to the boardwalk That takes you to the screen And farewell to the minutes They threaten you with it All inside the grounds of The walls of Red Wing  Its many a guard That stands around smiling Holding his club Like he was a king Hoping to get you Behind the wood piling All inside the grounds of The walls of Red Wing  The night aimed shadows Through the crossbar windows And the wind punched hard To make the wall-siding sing Its many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping All inside the grounds of The walls of Red Wing  As the rain rattled heavy On the bunkhouse shingles And the sounds of the night They made my ears ring Till the keys of the guards Clicked the tune of the morning All inside the grounds of The walls of Red Wing

sang the song slowly As she stood in the shadows She stepped to the light As my silver strings spun She called with her eyes To the tune Is a-playing But the song it was long And Id only begun  Through a bullet of light Her face was reflecting The fast fading words That rolled from my tongue With a long-distance look Her eyes was on fire But the song it was long And there was more to be sung  My eyes danced a circle Across her clear outline With her head tilted sideways She called me again As the tune drifted out She breathed hard through the echo But the song it was long And it was far to the end  I glanced at my guitar And played it pretending That of all the eyes out there I could see none As her thoughts pounded hard Like the pierce of an arrow But the song it was long And it had to get done  As the tune finally folded I laid down the guitar Then looked for the girl Whod stayed for so long But her shadow was missing For all of my searching So I picked up my guitar And began the next song', 'I have a poem here. Its not a poem, its... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. Hes really something else more than a folk singer and theres this book coming out thats dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldnt do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But Id like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, its a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called ""Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie""  When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb When you think youre too old, too young, too smart or too dumb When yer laggin behind an losing yer pace In a slow-motion crawl of lifes busy race No matter what yer doing if you start givin up If the wine dont come to the top of yer cup If the winds got you sideways with one hand holdin on And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it And the woods easy findin but yer lazy to fetch it And yer sidewalk starts curlin and the street gets too long And you start walkin backwards though you know its wrong And lonesome comes up as down goes the day And tomorrows morning seems so far away And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin And yer rope is a-slidin cause yer hands are a-drippin And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipes a-pourin And the lightnins a-flashing and the thunders a-crashin And the windows are rattlin and breakin and the roof tops a-shakin And yer whole worlds a-slamming  and banging And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm And to yourself you sometimes say ""I never knew it was gonna be this way Why didnt they tell me the day I was born"" And you start gettin chills and yer jumping from sweat And youre looking for something you aint quite found yet And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air And the whole worlds a-watching with a window peek stare And yer good gal leaves and shes long gone a-flying And yer heart feels sick like fish when theyre frying And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet And you need it badly but it lays on the street And yer bells bangin loudly but you cant hear its beat And you think yer ears might a been hurt Or yer eyesve turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush When you were faked out an fooled while facing a four flush And all the time you were holdin three queens And its making you mad, its makin you mean Like in the middle of Life magazine Bouncin around a pinball machine And theres something on yer mind you wanna be saying That somebody someplace oughta be hearin But its trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head And it bothers you badly when youre laying in bed And no matter how you try you just cant say it And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead And the lions mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth And his jaws start closing with you underneath And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind And you wish youd never taken that last detour sign And you say to yourself just what am I doing On this road Im walkin, on this trail Im turnin On this curve Im hanging On this pathway Im strolling, in the space Im taking In this air Im inhaling Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard Why am I walking, where am I running What am I saying, what am I knowing On this guitar Im playing, on this banjo Im frailin On this mandolin Im strumming, in the song Im singin In the tune Im humming, in the words Im writin In the words that Im thinking In this ocean of hours Im all the time drinkin Who am I helping, what am I breaking What am I giving, what am I taking But you try with your whole soul best Never to think these thoughts and never to let Them kind of thoughts gain ground Or make yer heart pound But then again you know when theyre around Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down Cause sometimes you hearem when the night times comes creeping And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin And you cant remember for the best of yer thinking If that was you in the dream that was screaming And you know that its something special youre needin And you know that theres no drug thatll do for the healin And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding And you need something special Yeah, you need something special all right You need a fast flying train on a tornado track To shoot you someplace and shoot you back You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler Thats been banging and booming and blowing forever That knows yer troubles a hundred times over You need a Greyhound bus that dont bar no race That wont laugh at yer looks Your voice or your face And by any number of bets in the book Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze You need something to open up a new door To show you something you seen before But overlooked a hundred times or more You need something to open your eyes You need something to make it known That its you and no one else that owns That spot that yer standing, that space that youre sitting That the world aint got you beat That it aint got you licked It cant get you crazy no matter how many Times you might get kicked You need something special all right You need something special to give you hope But hopes just a word That maybe you said or maybe you heard On some windy corner round a wide-angled curve  But thats what you need man, and you need it bad And yer trouble is you know it too good Cause you look an you start getting the chills  Cause you cant find it on a dollar bill And it aint on Macys window sill And it aint on no rich kids road map And it aint in no fat kids fraternity house And it aint made in no Hollywood wheat germ And it aint on that dimlit stage With that half-wit comedian on it Ranting and raving and taking yer money And you think its funny No you cant find it in no night club or no yacht club And it aint in the seats of a supper club And sure as hell youre bound to tell That no matter how hard you rub You just aint a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub No, and it aint in the rumors peoplere tellin you And it aint in the pimple-lotion people are sellin you And it aint in no cardboard-box house Or down any movie stars blouse And you cant find it on the golf course And Uncle Remus cant tell you and neither can Santa Claus And it aint in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes And it aint in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons And it aint in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices That come knockin and tappin in Christmas wrappin Sayin aint I pretty and aint I cute and look at my skin Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry When you cant even sense if they got any insides These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows No youll not now or no other day Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache And inside it the people made of molasses That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses And it aint in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies Whod turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny Who breathe and burp and bend and crack And before you can count from one to ten Do it all over again but this time behind yer back My friend The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl And play games with each other in their sand-box world And you cant find it either in the no-talent fools That run around gallant And make all rules for the ones that got talent And it aint in the ones that aint got any talent but think they do And think theyre foolin you The ones who jump on the wagon Just for a while cause they know its in style To get their kicks, get out of it quick And make all kinds of money and chicks And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat Sayin, ""Christ do I gotta be like that Aint there no one here that knows where Im at Aint there no one here that knows how I feel Good God Almighty THAT STUFF AINT REAL"" No but that aint yer game, it aint yer race You cant hear yer name, you cant see yer face You gotta look some other place And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin Where do you look for this lamp thats a-burnin Where do you look for this oil well gushin Where do you look for this candle thats glowin Where do you look for this hope that you know is there And out there somewhere And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways You can touch and twist And turn two kinds of doorknobs You can either go to the church of your choice Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital Youll find God in the church of your choice Youll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital  And though its only my opinion I may be right or wrong Youll find them both In the Grand Canyon At sundown', 'Lazy stadium night Catfish on the mound ""Strike

undertaker, he blows a futile horn ""Come in,"" she said, ""Ill give you shelter from the storm"" Ive heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?

innocence and got repaid with scorn ""Come in,"" she said, ""Ill give you shelter from the storm"" Well, Im livin in a foreign country but Im bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razors edge,

Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts  Backstage the girls were playing  five-card stud  by the stairs Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts  Big Jim was no ones fool, he owned the towns only diamond mine He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town She slipped in through the side door  looking like a queen without a crown She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear ""Sorry, darling, that Im late,"" but he didnt seem to hear He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts  ""I know Ive seen that face somewhere,"" Big Jim was thinking to himself "" Maybe down in Mexico  or a picture up on somebodys shelf"" But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts  Lily was a princess , she was fair-skinned and precious as a child She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere But shed never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts  The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind It was known all around that Lily had Jims ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the  king No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife She was tired of the attention , tired of playing the role of Big Jims wife She had done a lot of bad things,  even once tried suicide Was looking to do just one good deed before she died She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts  Lily took her dress off, buried it away ""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you must Have known it would someday Be careful not to touch the wall, theres a brand-new coat of paint Im glad to see youre still alive, youre looking like a saint"" Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts  The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair ""Theres something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air"" He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts  No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick The door to the dressing room burst open and  a Colt revolver clicked And Big Jim was standing there,  ya couldnt say surprised Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes She was with Big Jim but  she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts  Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, its said that they got off with quite a haul In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town But they couldnt go no further without the Jack of Hearts  The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black Big Jim lay covered up,  killed by a penknife in the back And Rosemary on the gallows, she didnt even blink The hanging judge was sober, he hadnt had a drink The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts  The cabaret was empty now,  a sign said, ""Closed for repair"" Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair She was thinking bout her father, who she very rarely saw Thinking bout Rosemary and thinking about the law But most of all she was thinking bout the Jack of Hearts', 'Early one morning the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if shed changed at all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was going to be rough They never did like Mamas homemade dress Papas bankbook wasnt big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows Ive paid some dues Getting through Tangled up in blue  She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder ""Well meet again someday On the avenue"" Tangled up in blue  I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I lucky was to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind And I just grew Tangled up in blue  She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the side of her face In the spotlight, so clear And later on, when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same She was standing there, in back of my chair Said to me ""Tell me, dont I know your name?"" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoe Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought youd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on Like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now Im going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know Theyre an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenters wives Dont know how it all got started I dont know what theyre doing with their lives But me, Im still on the road A-heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue',

Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts  Backstage the girls were playin five-card stud by the stairs Lily had two queens, she was hopin for a third to match her pair Outside the streets were fillin up, the window was open wide A gentle breeze was blowin, you could feel it from inside Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts  Big Jim was no ones fool, he owned the towns only diamond mine He made his usual entrance lookin so dandy and so fine With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town She slipped in through the side door lookin like a queen without a crown She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear ""Sorry, darlin, that Im late,"" but he didnt seem to hear He was starin into space over at the Jack of Hearts  ""I know Ive seen that face before,"" Big Jim was thinkin to himself ""Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf"" But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him Starin at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts  Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled Shed come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere But shed never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts  The hangin judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined The drillin in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind It was known all around that Lily had Jims ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king No, nothin ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts  Rosemary started drinkin hard and seein her reflection in the knife She was tired of the attention, tired of playin the role of Big Jims wife She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide Was lookin to do just one good deed before she died She was gazin to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts  Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away ""Has your luck run out?"" she laughed at him, ""Well, I guess you must Have known it would someday Be careful not to touch the wall, theres a brand-new coat of paint Im glad to see youre still alive, youre lookin like a saint"" Down the hallway footsteps were comin for the Jack of Hearts  The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair ""Theres something funny going on,"" he said, ""I can just feel it in the air"" He went to get the hangin judge, but the hangin judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts  Lilys arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch She forgot all about the man she couldnt stand who hounded her so much ""Ive missed you so,"" she said to him, and he felt she was sincere But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts  No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked And Big Jim was standin there, ya couldnt say surprised Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes She was with Big Jim but she was leanin to the Jack of Hearts  Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, its said that they got off with quite a haul In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town But they couldnt go no further without the Jack of Hearts  The next day was hangin day, the sky was overcast and black Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back And Rosemary on the gallows, she didnt even blink The hangin judge was sober, he hadnt had a drink The only person on the scene missin was the Jack of Hearts  The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, ""Closed for repair"" Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair She was thinkin bout her father, who she very rarely saw Thinkin bout Rosemary and thinkin about the law But most of all she was thinkin bout the Jack of Hearts', 'Meet

Old East Coast Lord knows hes paid some dues Getting through Tangled up in blue  She was married when they first met Soon to be divorced He helped her out of a jam, I guess But he used a little too much force And they drove that car as far as they could Abandoned it out West And split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best And she turned around to look at him As he was walking away She said ""This cant be the end Well meet on another day, on the avenue"" Tangled up in blue  He had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But he never liked it all that much And

close behind He seen a lot of women But she never escaped his mind And he just grew Tangled up in blue  She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the side of her face In the spotlight, so clear And later on, when the crowd thinned out I was about to do the same She was standing there, in back of my chair Said to me ""Whats your name?"" I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoes Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought youd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type"" Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue  He was always in a hurry Too busy or too stoned And everything that she ever planned Just had to be postponed He thought they were successful She thought they were blessed With objects and material things But I never was impressed And when it all came crashing down I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was keep on keepin on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now Im going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know Theyre an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are doctors wives Dont know how it all got started Dont know what theyre doing with their lives But me, Im still on the road Heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue', 'Buckets of rain Buckets of tears Got all them buckets comin out of my ears Buckets of moonbeams in my hand You got all the love, honey baby I can stand  I been meek And hard like an oak I seen pretty people disappear like smoke Friends will arrive, friends will disappear If you want me, honey baby Ill be here  Little red wagon Little red bike I aint no monkey but I know what I like I like the way you love me strong and slow Im takin you with me, honey baby When I go  I like your smile And your fingertips Like the way that you move your lips I like the cool way you look at me Everything about you is bringing me Misery  Life is sad Life is a bust All ya can do is do what you must You do what you must do and ya do it well Ill do it for you, honey baby Cant you tell?'}"

the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats Another day in the life on your way to your journeys end   Sailin through the trade winds bound for the South Rags on your back just like any other slave

ship that went down  Twas the fourteenth day of April Over the waves she rode Sailing into tomorrow To a gilded age foretold  The night was black with starlight The seas were sharp and clear Moving through the shadows The promised hour was near  Lights were holding steady Gliding over the foam All the lords and ladies Heading for their eternal home  The chandeliers were swaying From the balustrades above The orchestra was playing Songs of faded love  The watchman, he lay dreaming As the ballroom dancers twirled He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the underworld  Leo took his sketchbook He was often so inclined He closed his eyes and painted The scenery in his mind  Cupid struck his bosom And broke it with a snap The closest woman to him He fell into her lap  He heard a loud commotion Something sounded wrong His inner spirit was saying That he couldnt stand here long  He staggered to the quarterdeck No time now to sleep Water on the quarterdeck Already three foot deep  Smokestack was leaning sideways Heavy feet began to pound He walked into the whirlwind Sky splitting all around  The ship was going under The universe had opened wide The roll was called up yonder The angels turned aside  Lights down in the hallway Flickering dim and dull Dead bodies already floating In the double bottom hull  The engines then exploded Propellers they failed to start The boilers overloaded The ships bow split apart  Passengers were flying Backward, forward, far and fast They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled Each one more weary than the last  The veil was torn asunder Tween the hours of twelve and one No change, no sudden wonder Could undo what had been done  The watchman lay there dreaming At forty-five degrees He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking Dropping to her knees  Wellington he was sleeping His bed began to slide His valiant heart was beating He pushed the tables aside  Glass of shattered crystal Lay scattered roundabout He strapped on both his pistols How long could he hold out?  His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene  The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere  Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side  Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers  The rich man, Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing Be the last trip of his life  Calvin, Blake, and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale or disembark  Brother rose up gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance  They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors, there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks  The bishop left his cabin To help all those in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""  Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world  Jim Backus  smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him  He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace  They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldnt hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold  Leo said to Cleo I think Im going mad But hed lost his mind already Whatever mind he had  He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm  Petals fell from flowers Tell all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizards curse played on  The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go  There were many, many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before  The watchman, he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone  The captain, barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel  He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race  In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears  When the Reapers task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good, the bad, the rich, the poor The loveliest and the best  They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding For the judgment of Gods hand  The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force The love had lost its fires All things had run their course  The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea', 'Its been such a long long time Since we loved each other when our hearts were true One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you Last night I heard you talking in your sleep Saying things you shouldnt say, oh baby You just may have to go to jail someday  Is there a place we can go?
